# MariaDB2LDAP
MariaDB2LDAP is a simple python program which replicates all MariaDB contacts entries in LDAP.

This programm has been made because of the needs of users.
We needed to replicate the zimbra's user's contacts list into LDAP, thus we made a user on zimbra called "contacts@example.com" we insert there the contacts and with a cron job, we import those contacts into LDAP in order to make able the phones to read contacts from LDAP.

The code may seem rude, it has been made very fastly.
